        "output": "I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. Being ghosted by a friend can be very hurtful and confusing. It's important to remember that you're not alone in feeling this way. It's okay to feel upset or disappointed.\n\nHere are a few suggestions for coping:\n\n1. Allow Yourself to Feel: Your feelings are valid and it's important to let yourself feel them rather than trying to suppress them. It's okay to grieve the loss of the friendship.\n\n2. Reach Out: If you feel comfortable, you may want to reach out to your friend one more time to express your feelings. Remember to be respectful and understanding, as they may be going through a difficult time themselves.\n\n3. Self-Care: Engage in activities that make you happy and relaxed. This could include reading a book, taking a walk, meditating, or spending time with other loved ones.\n\n4. Seek Support: Talk to other friends or family members about what you're experiencing. They can provide a listening ear, comfort, and advice.\n\n5. Acceptance: Sometimes, we don't get the closure we want. It's important to eventually come to terms with the situation and understand that it's a reflection of the other person's actions, not your self-worth.\n\nIf these feelings persist or become overwhelming, you might find it helpful to speak with a mental health professional. They can provide you with more personalized coping strategies and here are some resources that might be helpful:\n\n- National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 988\n- Crisis Text Line: Text HOME to 741741\n- NAMI Helpline: 1-800-950-NAMI (6264)\n- SAMHSA's National Helpline: 1-800-662-HELP (4357)\n\nRemember, it's okay to ask for help when you need it. You don't have to go through this alone."
