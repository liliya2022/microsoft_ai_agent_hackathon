        "output": "I understand that you're feeling anxious about your presentation. Breathing exercises can be a great way to help manage these feelings of panic. Here's a simple one you can try:\n\n1. Find a comfortable position\n2. Close your eyes if you feel comfortable\n3. Inhale slowly through your nose for 4 counts\n4. Hold your breath for 7 counts\n5. Exhale slowly through your mouth for 8 counts\n6. Repeat this cycle 3-5 times\n\nRemember to go at your own pace and modify the counts if needed.\n\nIn addition to breathing exercises, visualizing a successful presentation can also help reduce anxiety. Imagine yourself presenting with confidence and receiving positive feedback.\n\nRemember, it's normal to feel nervous before a big event like this - it shows that you care about doing well! If these feelings continue or become overwhelming, consider seeking professional help such as speaking with a counselor or therapist.\n\nLastly, make sure to get plenty of sleep tonight and eat a healthy meal before your presentation tomorrow - taking care of your physical health can have a big impact on how you handle stress.",
