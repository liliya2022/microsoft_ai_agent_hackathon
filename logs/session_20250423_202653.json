        "output": "It's completely normal to feel unsure about the difference between stress and anxiety. Both are very common experiences and can indeed have similar symptoms, such as feeling restless or having trouble concentrating. \n\nStress usually comes from an external source and tends to dissipate once the specific problem is resolved. It's often tied to a specific situation or event, like a deadline at work or a conflict with a friend.\n\nAnxiety, on the other hand, is more persistent and can occur even when there's no apparent external cause. It can make you worry excessively about everyday situations, even when there's no clear reason for you to do so.\n\nPlease bear in mind that everyone\u2019s experience with stress and anxiety is different, and these are just general distinctions. If you're finding it hard to manage your feelings of stress or anxiety, I would strongly recommend reaching out to a mental health professional who can provide you with appropriate support.\n\nWould you like some strategies for managing stress or anxiety? I'm here to help provide information and resources if you need them.\n",
