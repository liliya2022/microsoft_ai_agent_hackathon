        "output": "I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. It can be very hurtful when someone we care about suddenly cuts off contact without any explanation. It's important to remember that their actions are a reflection of their own struggles and not a measure of your worth. \n\nHere are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Reach Out: You might want to send them one more message to express your concern and let them know you're there for them if they're ready to talk. Try to keep it simple and non-confrontational. Something like, \"Hey, I've noticed we haven't talked in a while. I hope you're okay. If you ever want to talk, I'm here.\"\n\n2. Give Them Space: If they still don't respond, it might be best to give them some space. They might be dealing with personal issues that they're not ready to share.\n\n3. Self-Care: It's also really important to take care of your own emotional health during this time. Do things you enjoy, spend time with other friends and family, or engage in activities that help you relax and destress.\n\n4. Seek Support: If you find this experience is causing you significant distress, it might be helpful to talk with a counselor or therapist. They can provide strategies to cope with the feelings of rejection and loss.\n\nFinally, remember that it's okay to feel hurt and confused right now. Your feelings are valid. It's normal to need time to heal after an unexpected end to a friendship.\n\nWould you like me to find some resources on coping with rejection and loss of a friend using the get_mental_health_resources tool?"
