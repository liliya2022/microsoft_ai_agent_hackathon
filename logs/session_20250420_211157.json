You could try walking, running, yoga, or any other form of exercise that you enjoy.\n\n4. **Maintaining a Consistent Sleep Schedule**: Lack of sleep or irregular sleep patterns can worsen symptoms of depression. Try to establish a regular sleep routine and ensure you're getting enough rest.\n\nPlease remember that while these strategies can help, they are not a substitute for professional help. If you're feeling depressed, it's important to reach out to a mental health professional who can provide you with the appropriate treatment and support."
